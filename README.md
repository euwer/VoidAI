### 🚀 How Does This Void Magic Happen?! 🚀

It's simpler than crafting a wooden pickaxe (and way cooler)! This plugin harnesses the raw power of cutting-edge AI from VOIDAI to answer your burning Minecraft questions right in the game. Just follow these ridiculously easy steps:

1.  **Grab Your Secret Void Essence (API Key):** You know that super-secret API key you got from VOIDAI? Yeah, *that* one. Keep it safe, guard it with your life (or at least your best iron sword).
2.  **Communicate with the Void (config.yml):** Head over to the plugin's config file (`config.yml`). It's probably chilling in your server's `plugins/[PluginName]` folder. Open it up and you'll see something like this (but probably with even MORE excitement):

    ```yaml
    # 🌌 Configure the VOIDAI here! 🌌
    api-key: your-openai-api-key
    model: your-openai-model
    ```

    **IMPORTANT!!!** Replace `your-openai-api-key` with your actual VOIDAI API key. And put the name of the AI model you want to use where it says `your-openai-model`. Don't mess this up, or the AI might get confused and start telling you how to bake a cake instead of finding diamonds! 🍰💎
3.  **Channel the Void's Knowledge (/soru):** Once you've got the config all set up, hop back into Minecraft and type `/soru` followed by your question. For example:

    ```
    /soru How do I craft a diamond pickaxe?
    /soru Where can I find slime?
    /soru What's the best way to defeat the Ender Dragon?
    /soru Why is my chicken farm not working?! (The AI might not know this one, but it'll try its best!)
    ```

    **BOOM!** The VOIDAI will process your question and BAM! The answer will appear right in your chat! It's like having a super-smart Minecraft entity living inside your server! 🤯

### 🛠️ Installation - It's Easier Than Escaping the Void! 🛠️

1.  Download the `.jar` file of this amazing plugin. (You'll find it somewhere cool, probably where all the other awesome plugins hang out).
2.  Drag and drop that `.jar` file into your Minecraft server's `plugins` folder.
3.  **RESTART YOUR SERVER!** (This is super important! Don't skip this step unless you like things breaking... which you probably don't).
4.  Navigate to the `plugins/[PluginName]` folder and open up that sweet `config.yml` file to enter your API key and model name (as described above).
5.  **RESTART YOUR SERVER AGAIN!** (Yeah, sometimes it takes two energy drinks to get things going).
6.  Jump into Minecraft and start asking away with `/soru`!

### ⚠️ Important Stuff (Read This Before the Void Consumes You!) ⚠️

* **API Key Security:** Keep your API key secret! Don't share it with anyone you wouldn't trust with your precious ender pearls!
* **VOIDAI Limitations:** Remember that even the VOID isn't all-knowing. It might sometimes give incorrect or strange answers. Use your best judgment! If VOIDAI tells you to stare directly at an enderman, **MAYBE DON'T!** 👁️‍🗨️
* **Rate Limiting:** Be mindful of the API usage limits of VOIDAI. Spamming it with questions might result in your API key being temporarily blocked. Play it cool! 😉
* **Permissions:** Make sure your players have the necessary permissions to use the `/soru` command (you might need to configure this in your server's permissions plugin).
